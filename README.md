brew install nvm
```

## ðŸ§­ Quickstart

Create a `.env` file and add the proper credentials, as in the example below:

```
BOT_TOKEN=12345

```

### Bot commands

```
/serverinfo - needs 3 parameters, game type (e.g. counterstrike2, valheim, etc.), host (e.g. 86.124.33.6) and port (e.g. 27015)
/monitorserveer - needs 3 parameters, game type (e.g. counterstrike2, valheim, etc.), host (e.g. 86.124.33.6) and port (e.g. 27015). updates the current channel every 300 seconds (5 minutes) with the server status.
/stopmonitor - stops the monitoring in the current channel
```

### Supported games

When using either `/serverinfo` or `/monitorserver` commands, the game type needs to exist [here](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig/blob/HEAD/GAMES_LIST.md). If you query for an invalid game type or if the server is offline, the bot will show the appropriate error.
